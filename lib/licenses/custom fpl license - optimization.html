<H1>Nonlinear Optimization Java Package</H1>



<p>
New as of 5/10/10 --- Dr.-Ing. Andreas Maier reports that he 
has created a version of the fmin and Uncmin codes that
permits "the parallel evaluation of functions, gradients, and Hessians
(for computationally expensive functions)."  The package can be
obtained at
<a
href="http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/research/software/java-parallel-optimization-package/">
www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/research/software/java-parallel-optimization-package/</a>


<p>
Currently (as of 8/8/05) this package contains Java translations
of the 1-dimensional
minimization routine, fmin, the multi-dimensional minimization
routine
Uncmin, the MINPACK nonlinear least squares routines (lmder1,
lmder, lmdif1, and lmdif), and the SLATEC 1-dimensional zero-finding
routine,
dfzero.  Eventually, the 
package 
will also contain 
Java translations of some of the MINPACK nonlinear equation
solvers.

<p>
The 1-dimensional minimization routine is an <b>unofficial</b> 
Java translation of the
FORTRAN version of the public domain fmin routine that can be found
at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/go/fmin.f">www.netlib.org/go/fmin.f</a>.

<p>
The multi-dimensional minimization routine is an <b>unofficial</b> 
Java translation of the public domain FORTRAN Uncmin package 
(<a href="umdpn.f">umdpn.f</a>).  For documentation see
Dennis and Schnabel, <i>Numerical Methods for Unconstrained
Optimization and Nonlinear Equations</i>, Prentice-Hall, 1983, and
Schnabel, Koontz, and Weiss, "A Modular System of Algorithms for
Unconstrained Minimization," <i>ACM Transactions of Mathematical
Software</i>, 1985, pages 419 -- 440.
<p>
Uncmin can perform <i>unconstrained</i> nonlinear optimizations.
Here is information about
<a href="constrained.html">constrained</a> nonlinear optimizations.

<p>
The nonlinear least squares routines are <b>unofficial</b> 
Java translations of the
FORTRAN versions of the public domain MINPACK nonlinear least squares
routines that can be found
at <a href="http://www.netlib.org/minpack">www.netlib.org/minpack</a>.

<p>
The 1-dimensional zero-finding routine is an <b>unofficial</b> 
Java translation of the
FORTRAN version of the public domain SLATEC dfzero routine that can be found
at netlib.  Either go to
<a href="http://www.netlib.org">www.netlib.org</a> and do a search for
dfzero.f, or go to 
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/slatec">www.netlib.org/slatec</a> and
download the entire SLATEC library.

<h1>Warning!!!</h1>
<ul>
<li> These routines were translated by a user of numerical analysis
routines rather than a developer.  When Java optimization routines
written by professional
numerical analysts become
available, they should be used.
<li> I have tried to be careful with the coding and have done some
simple testing (see the FminTest, UncminTest_f77,
LmderTest_f77, LmdifTest_f77, and FzeroTest applications).  
However, it is quite possible that I have introduced
errors into the routines in the course of the translations.  If you
detect bugs in fmin, Uncmin, MINPACK, or fzero, PLEASE contact me
(Steve Verrill at <a
href="mailto:steve@swst.org"><kbd>sverrill@fs.fed.us</kbd></a>
or 608-231-9375).<p>
Note that <a href="minpack.prob.html">for
"pathological" problems, results can depend upon
programming details or the version of the Java Developer's Kit.</a><p>

<li> Uncmin_f77.java, UncminTest_f77.java, Minpack_f77.java,
LmderTest_f77.java, and LmdifTest_f77.java make use of FORTRAN style
indexing.  
In these you will tend to see
<pre>
   for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
</pre>
rather than
<pre>
   for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
</pre>
To use the "_f77" routines you will have to declare your vectors
and matrices to be one element larger (e.g., v[101] rather than
v[100], and a[101][101] rather than a[100][100]), and you will have
to fill elements 1 through n rather than elements 0 through n - 1.
See UncminTest_f77.java.
<p>
Eventually, classes that make use of Java/C style indexing might
become available (actually, this is unlikely).

<p>
<i>Given the manner in which the routines are currently written,</i>
you will need to import them (see the beginning of 
UncminTest_f77.java).  All of the classes
will have to be placed
in subdirectories of a directory in your CLASSPATH.
For the optimization classes, this subdirectory will 
have to be called optimization.  For the Blas_f77 class, this
subdirectory will have to be called linear_algebra.
Console.class 
will have to be placed in a 
subdirectory called corejava.
<p>
Note that if you install the software in this manner,
then to run, for example, FminTest you will have to issue the command:<br>
<pre>
java optimization.FminTest
</pre>
<i>Alternatively,</i> you could remove the package and import statements
(other than import java.lang.*) in the source code,
and compile all of the necessary files in the same directory.
<p>
To run Fmin you will need to write a driver
class such as FminTest that implements the Fmin_methods
interface.  This class will have to include an f_to_minimize method.
<p>
To run Uncmin_f77 you will need to write a driver
class such as UncminTest_f77 that implements the Uncmin_methods
interface.  This class will have to include an f_to_minimize method
and, at the least, dummy gradient and hessian methods.
<p>
To run Minpack_f77 you will need to write a driver
class such as LmderTest_f77 or LmdifTest_f77 that implements
the Lmder_fcn or Lmdif_fcn
interface.  This class will have to include an fcn method.
<p>
To run Fzero you will need to write a driver
class such as FzeroTest that implements the Fzero_methods
interface.  This class will have to include an f_to_zero method.

<h1>Console.java</h1>

Console.java is software described in Cornell
and Horstmann's <i>Core Java</i> (SunSoft Press/Prentice-Hall).
(I like this book.)
It may be used for non-commerical purposes.  I
only make use of it in the testing routines.
